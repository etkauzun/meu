    "Rather than getting data on every player, imagine that we had gotten data on only a smaller subset of the players.  For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky.  Instead, we often make *statistical inferences* about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statistical inference** is a statement about some statistic of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3 million\".  You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts.  It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences can be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general strategy for inference using samples is to estimate statistics of the population by computing the same statistics on a sample.  This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.  The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factors, and we'll touch lightly on a few of those today.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important factor in the utility of samples is how they were gathered.  We have prepared some example sample datasets to simulate inference from different kinds of samples for the NBA player dataset.  Later we'll ask you to create your own samples to see how they behave."

You want to remind yourself how unlikely it is to win a jackpot. Call the function simulate_one_ticket 100,000 times (this would cost at least $300,000 if you were to buy that many!). How many times did you win the jackpot? Assign your answer to `count_jackpot`.\n",
